# University Program Finder

A  search tool that compiles undergraduate programs from Ontario Tech University and McGill University into clear, easy-to-navigate tables. 
Built to reduce the stress of the university application process for high school students.

## 🚀 Overview

Navigating university websites can be overwhelming for high school students trying to find prerequisites, programs, and deadlines across multiple universities. 

This project was started after a conversation with a high school friend who told me how frustrating and time-consuming it was to go through different university websites, often manually clicking through dozens of pages to find program details.

To solve this, I built a tool that scrapes and compiles program data into a single, searchable interface. Now, instead of navigating multiple university websites, students can use **Ctrl+F** to quickly find the program, prerequisite, or school they’re interested in. All in one place.

## 🎯 Features

- Web-scraped data from Ontario Tech and McGill University
- Clean, user-friendly tables designed for fast keyword search
- Program names, prerequisites, and links all in one place
- Designed for high school students, educators, and guidance counsellors

## 💡 Inspiration

This idea came from a real pain point, a high school friend who was overwhelmed trying to apply to university. The stress of visiting every individual school site, digging for information, and manually tracking prerequisites made the process harder than it needed to be. I realized this wasn't a small problem, I myself dealt with the same issue when applying to undergrad and I'm sure others did as well.

So I asked: **what if all that info could be found in one place?**

## 📈 Community & Scaling

I began sharing this project with guidance counsellors across Toronto, who have expressed strong interest in a tool like this. As I gather feedback, I plan to scale the project by:

- Adding more universities across Ontario and Canada
- Improving filtering and sorting functionality
- Creating a mobile-friendly version

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** (for scraping)
- **BeautifulSoup / Requests**
- **Pandas** (for data cleaning and formatting)
